# Virtual World

## General info

The *Virtual World* is a project created for learning purposes by the student of Gdansk University of Technology. It was required for Object Oriented Programming laboratory classes. The application (names, logs, etc.) runs in Polish language.

This application simulates virtual world in a very simple way (using *Tkinter* library for graphics) and it uses a turn-based approach. It implements fighting and multiplication mechanisms. 

A player can take actions as a man (by arrow keys, and space for superpower activation) and all of the other objects take actions by themselves depending on their nature and special skills. After setting up next move a player should click the button *Kolejna Tura* to advance to the next turn and apply the move. The simulation can continue even after man's death.

## Requirements

Python should be installed to be able to run the project.

## Building

In order to run the project use the following command from the *src* directory:
